        1. Prime Number:
                        Prime number is a number that can be divided
                        by 1 or by itself only. For example 7 is Prime
                        Number because it can be divided into 7 or 1, but
                        not to any number. For instance if we divide 7 by 2
                        we would get decimal answer

         2. Fibonacci - is sequence of numbers. For example this is a number
                        which as a result of 2 previous numbers' addition
                        we get the result of the 3rd number
                        For instance 1 + 1 is 2, 1+ 2 is 3, 2+3 is 5 and so on

          3. Print letters from your name that their index is at even number
          4. Find even numbers and odd numbers from an array and store them
             separately in 2 different arrays.
          5. Swap Strings without using 3rd variable
          6. Sort the string
          7. Take the sentence from string and convert it into an array and reverse from
            that array only the ones whose index is even.
          8. Sort an array - optional
